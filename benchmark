Benchmark (English Version)

To evaluate system performance, a benchmark script (benchmark.ipynb) compares the three implemented approaches: OMNI VLM, YOLOv5, and the Custom Method.
The benchmark includes both accuracy and speed (inference time) metrics measured on the same test video.

Results are presented in tables and visual charts, showing:

Detection accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Average inference time per frame (FPS)

People counting accuracy within the predefined zone

The goal of this comparison is to determine which method provides the best balance between accuracy and real-time performance, particularly for deployment on Raspberry Pi
